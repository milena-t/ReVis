## bug fixes

* The default output directory in base ReVis -> currently the default if it is not specified is supposed to be the current working directory, but that somehow adds "None" as a prefix in front of the filename? haven't figured out yet where that shows up.

## improvement suggestions

### Base ReVis

* Add an option to give custom names instead of contig names to the contigs in the plot

### Gene surroundings ReVis

* try a polynomial regression to get confidence intervals and see if the enrichment of some categories is significant
