# ReVis

Visualize the output of repeatmasker. 

## Installation

Download the latest release and unzip it. You can just run the python script as described in quickstart below. You might have to install a few external dependencies manually (see `requirements.txt`) but they are all commonly used libraries easy to install with `pip`.

### Dependencies

 *  On uppmax, load biopython/1.80-py3.10.8 to use argparse (base python doesn't include it).
 *  Libraries imported by any script:
    - sys, re, os, subprocess, argparse
    - tqdm, random, time
    - dataclasses, enum, pandas, tempfile, SeqIO
    - matplotlib

(Sorry if I forgot any, I'm sure the compiler will tell you if you miss something)

# Run modes

You can make two different kinds of plots with ReVis:

## Genome wide

You can show the repeat content across a genome in a stacked histogram of the different repeat categories. The windows are non-overlapping, and optionally a line of the gene numbers (mean over a specified multiple windows) can be included.

![B. siliquastri repeat landscape](example_data/repeat_abundance_with_gene_numbers_in_b_siliquastri.png) 

## Gene surroundings

It is also possible to look at the repeat landscape in the up and downstream sequence of specific genes. The repeat abundance is calculated for individual bases (not windows), the repeat content in the upstream and downstream regions of a list of "foreground" genes compared to a wider set of "background" to assess differences.

# ReVis Histograms (genome wide mode)

## Quick start

```bash
python3 ReVis.py \
    --masker_outfile your_assembly.fna.ori.out \
    --masker_out_gff your_assembly.fna.out.gff \
    --out_dir ./ \
    --species_name Y_species \
    --window_length 1e6 \
    --plot_overlap_filtered \
    --verbose \
    --plot
```


(TODO: fix default for no given output directory! --> explicitly use `--out_dir ./` for now)

## Input options

Above are quickstart options, see all possible options with the `-h` flag or at the end of this documentation. Contigs are sorted by size decreasing in the plot.

### Files

* Repeatmasker outfiles (do not change file extensions!!):
  * `your_assembly.fna.ori.out`
  * `your_assembly.fna.out.gff`
* Optional:
  * genome annotation 1
  * genome annotation 2

(you do not need an assembly, the gff generated by repeatmasker contains ##sequence-region comments with the contig name and length)

### Parameters

* Species name (formatted like D_melanogaster for *Drosophila melanogaster*)
* window length (basepairs, can be in scientific notation like 1e6 for 1Mb)
* plot or table mode

# Documentation

download the latest release and just run `ReVis.py` like a normal python script. The dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`, they are only commonly used python packages and can be installed with pip. 

The script is using the output files generated by repeatmasker, the masked assembly, and optionally one or two genome annotations based on the same assembly (contig names have to match!). Results can be plotted in a stacked histogram (plot mode) or returned as tsv files (table mode, requires the annotation!). 

### Overlapping repeat annotations

Repeatmasker allows overlapping repeat annotations. They say that this is to detect e.g. when one transposable element inserts itself into an already existing repeat. These overlaps can result in a repeat percentage of over 100% in a window. For plotting purposes, I have implemented a method of removing these overlaps. The overlap is filtered by cutting the beginning of the current repeat based on the end of the previous one. Below is a quick example of two repeat categories `-` and `*` that overlap in their annotated position, and how my script handles these overlaps

```
unfiltered overlapping repeats
--------------------        ----------------                                     -------------              
            *************************************               *************************

filtered repeats that do not overlap any more
--------------------*****************************               *************************-----
```

(Repeats completely inserted into other repeats that span a wider region are filtered out completely)

When I test filtering vs. no filtering on some species, the "shape" of the plots tends to stay the same, and the repeat proportions are similar to a certain extend. However, since some repeat categories are more prone to be completely inserted than others, this can change the proportions. If you want to run the overlap filtered version to avoid repeat abundances >>100%, you should also do a test run with unfiltered plotting to make sure that you are not greatly distorting the repeat proportions.

## Detailed description

This script analyzes repeatmasker output. You can run in two modes, plot mode or table mode. Plot mode returns 
a plot with a stacked histogram of all the repeat categories (overlap filtered! Repeat annotations can be on top of each other, 
where two or more repeats cover the same stretch of sequence, which can result in a >100% repeat coverage in some rep_windows. 
You can filter out repeat categories that overlap with others so that each base is only covered by one repeat annotation.
This filtering warps the category proportion in some windows, because it is likely that there are more bases of some categories 
removed than others. See get_repeat_abundance function documentation for details). If you include a genome annotation, 
a line for the number of annotated genes in the same windows is added. You can add up to two annotations to compare them.
Table mode returns the same by-window information as a tsv file with the proportion of basepairs in each window 
covered by each repeat category (NOT overlap filtered, so there can be more bp covered by all repeats in a window than the number
of masked bp or even the window length) and also the number of bp and ratio covered by coding regions (exons). If the masked
assembly is given it will also include the number of unmasked bp in each window.

It takes as input two of the repeatmasker output files, *.ori.out (but just *.out also works, only slower), and *.out.gff

The runtime depends on the overall repeat content and on how fragmented the assembly is. I have tried my best to optimize, 
but if your assembly is long and fragmented, it takes long to loop through many small contigs, and if there are many repeats, 
it takes long to sum all of them up per window. Short windows increase the total number of windows computed and plotted, 
which also increases the runtime. In any case, the longest runtime i managed to achieve with my data was 3:30 min.

Good luck!

## Detailed flags
```
-h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --masker_outfile MASKER_OUTFILE
                        repeatmasker output file ending in .out 
                            (I really recommend .ori.out, but both work, the other one is just slower)
  --masker_out_gff MASKER_OUT_GFF
                        repeatmasker output file ending in .out.gff
                            If not given it will be assumed to have the same basename as .out and inferred automatically.
                            (which is true if you didn't change anything about the repeatmasker outfile names.) 
                            (This technically contains the same information as the .out file, but it also has "sequence region" annotations
                            which have all the contig lengths. These would otherwise have to be extracted from the assembly and this is just faster.)
  --table               The output of the program is the tsv file with all values
  --plot                The output of the program is the plot
  --annotation_gff ANNOTATION_GFF
                        If you want to include a line that shows the gene density in each window, 
                            you can give an annotation based on the same assembly (with matching contig names!)
  --annotation_gff2 ANNOTATION_GFF2
                        You can include a second annotation as well if you want to and show to different lines.
  --gene_density        If you give an annotation, by default you will get the number of genes per window, 
                            but you may also calculate the ratio: number of genes / window length with this option
  --assembly_path ASSEMBLY_PATH
                        If you want to compute the table with all the per-window values you need to include the
                            masked assembly, so that the number of masked/unmasked bases can be computed properly. It should be the assembly that was masked in this repeatmasker
                            run and also the assembly that is the basis for the annotation
  --species_name SPECIES_NAME
                        species identifier string, like 'C_maculatus', '_' will be replaced with '. ' 
                            (Include this! If not included it will try to parse it automatically from the start of filenames, 
                            which will probably only work for how i named my files)
  --window_length WINDOW_LENGTH
                        window length (scientific notation like 1e6 is ok)
  --out_dir OUT_DIR     path to output directory. If not given all files will be saved in current working directory
  --merge_gene_windows MERGE_GENE_WINDOWS
                        If an annotation is included to show gene density, 
                            the gene density is likely difficult to interpret visually if you show it for each repeat-window.
                            Here you can choose how many windows you would like to average over, 
                            default = 5
                            put 1 if you don't want any averaging
  --plot_overlap_filtered
                        use the overlap-filtered repeats for plotting
  --plot_white_background
                        the plot does NOT have a transparent background, but white instead
  --verbose             print progress in the command line (recommended, on by default)
  --statistics          print contig-specific repeat statistics (optional, increases output length quite a bit, off by default)
                            Prints repeat information (and gene numbers if applicable) for each contig, mostly for debugging purposes
```

## Summary

Each table has a row for each repeat category, and each column is one base. The number in the cell is how often this base position is annotated with a repeat of one category in all the transcripts considered. It also generates a file where it saves the number of transcripts considered for foreground and background respectively, so that the repeat counts from the tables can be normalized into a percentage for comparability.

Since I get the foreground and background transcripts from orthofinder and CAFE analysis of a set of species, these are the data structures that I have tested this code with the most. This is also why they are mostly refered to as "sig" (significant) for the foreground transcripts and "all" for the background transcripts. I did try to implement an option where you can pass lists of transcript IDs (corresponding to your annotation) in the command line directly for the foreground and background transcripts, if you are not using orthofinder/cafe, but I didn't exactly test it rigorously so it may not work.

ReVis_transcript_surroundings.py comptues four tables:
* foreground transcripts sequences:
    * before transcript start
    * after transcript start
* background transcripts sequences:
    * before transcript start
    * after transcript start

and one file that contains the number of transcripts used to calculate the foreground and background tables, to use for calculating the percentages when plotting

You can specify how many bp up and downstream from a transcript border you want to check (default 500). This is not a fast program, so I have found that 10k bp is a nice compromise of seeing interesting dynamics and it not taking too long. The test plot with *B. siliquastri* took less than 10 mins for 10k bp, but more repeat rich genomes will take longer, as will longer foreground and background lists. When I run it with a different species that has a 1 Gb genome, 70% repeats and I set 10 kb up and downstream it takes almost two hours.

You can pass these parameters
* `bp` (how many bp up- and downstream of a transcript to compute and plot)
* `gene family size percentile` (recommended! for the sig. table, only genes that are part of actually expanding gene families (whose size is in the upper nth size percentile, not just all sig. evolving orthogroups, are included)
* If you are doing orthofinder/CAFE: `species name` (matching one in the orthofinder output!!!)
